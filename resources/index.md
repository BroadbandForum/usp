## USP Development Resources

In addition to the TR-369 specification and data models, a number of resources are available to those building and deploying USP based solutions.

* **[OB-USP-Agent](https://github.com/BroadbandForum/obuspa)** - This is the official Open Broadband project, operated by the Broadband Forum, for an open-source reference implementation of a USP Agent.

* **[USP Record Protocol Buffers Schema](https://usp.technology/specification/usp-record-1-1.proto)** - A direct link to the USP specification's protocol buffers schema for USP Records.

* **[USP Message Protocol Buffers Schema](https://usp.technology/specification/usp-msg-1-1.proto)** - A direct link to the USP specification's protocol buffers schema for USP Messages contained in USP records.

* **[Controller REST API defintion](https://github.com/BroadbandForum/usp/blob/master/api/swagger-usp-controller-v1.yaml)** - A direct link to the USP Controller's REST API definition, which can also be opened in a Swagger / Open API viewer or editor (like "https://editor.swagger.io").

* **[MTP Proxy](https://github.com/BroadbandForum/usp/tree/master/mtp-proxy)** - The direct link to the MTP Proxy python code that is used as a reference implementation for proxying between USP Controllers and USP Agents that utilize different MTPs.

* **[Compliance and Certification](https://usp-compliance.broadband-forum.org/)** - Broadband Forum TR-469 defines the conformance test cases for USP Agents. This document forms the basis of the USP certification program. Look for more on the certification program in early 2020.
