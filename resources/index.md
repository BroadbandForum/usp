In addition to the TR-369 specification and data models, a number of resources are available to those building and deploying USP based solutions.

official Open Broadband project, operated by the Broadband Forum, for an open-
source reference implementation of a USP Agent.

**[BBF.369 USP Agent Certification Program](https://www.broadband-forum.org/testing-and-certification-programs/bbf-369-usp-certification)** - Here you can
learn how to get your products tested and listed as certified for use with USP.

Controller's REST API definition, which can also be opened in a Swagger / Open
