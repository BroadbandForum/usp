# First User Services Platform "Plugfest"

A "plugfest", also known as a "hackfest" in the software community, is a live event
where engineers building solutions for a given protocol interact with each other
to vet the protocol and build interoperable solutions.

## Logistics

The date of the plugfest is tentatively set for November 28-30, 2017. Location TBD.

## What will be tested?

The first plugfest will focus on the USP Discovery process, authentication and authorization,
message interoperability, and use cases such as firmware updates of the device represented
by a USP Agent.

## Data Model Profiles for the Plugfest

The BBF has identified the set of objects, parameters, commands, and notifications
to be tested at the plugfest. This set represents a baseline level of functionality
for USP in order to build interoperable endpoints. These profiles include:

* [DRAFT-Challenge:1 Profile](http://usp.technology/data-model/tr-181-2-12-usp-full.html#H.Device:2.DRAFT-Challenge:1 Profile)
* [DRAFT-Controllers:1 Profile](http://usp.technology/data-model/tr-181-2-12-usp-full.html#H.Device:2.DRAFT-Controllers:1 Profile)
* [DRAFT-DeviceInfo:1 Profile](http://usp.technology/data-model/tr-181-2-12-usp-full.html#H.Device:2.DRAFT-DeviceInfo:1 Profile)
* [DRAFT-Firmware:1 Profile](http://usp.technology/data-model/tr-181-2-12-usp-full.html#H.Device:2.DRAFT-Firmware:1 Profile)

* [DRAFT-Subscriptions:1 Profile](http://usp.technology/data-model/tr-181-2-12-usp-full.html#H.Device:2.DRAFT-Subscriptions:1 Profile)

If you are using tools that utilize these profiles, the profiles are unified under the [DRAFT:1 Profile](http://usp.technology/data-model/tr-181-2-12-usp-full.html#H.Device:2.DRAFT:1 Profile).

# FAQ

## Who makes the User Services Platform?

<p style="margin-top:4ex;"><a href="http://www.broadband-forum.org"><img src="/assets/img/broadband-forum-logo.png"></a></p>

USP is developed by the [Broadband Forum](http://www.broadband-forum.org), an international standards organization of network service providers/MSOs, end user device manufacturers, government and university organizations, and test laboratories. It is developed in the "Broadband User Services" [Work Area](https://www.broadband-forum.org/standards-and-software/downloads/work-areas-projects).

## How can I contribute?

Feedback and questions can always be given via GitHub. Due to the standards process adopted by the Broadband Forum, a contributing Broadband Forum member must adopt suggested changes and present them to the Forum as a contribution from their company. An even easier way is to [become a member](https://www.broadband-forum.org/about-the-broadband-forum/membership/becoming-a-bbf-member) and contribute directly.
