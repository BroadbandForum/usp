## How can I contribute?

Feedback and questions can always be given via GitHub. Due to the standards process adopted by the Broadband Forum, a contributing Broadband Forum member must adopt suggested changes and present them to the Forum as a contribution from their company. An even easier way is to [become a member](https://www.broadband-forum.org/about-the-broadband-forum/membership/becoming-a-bbf-member) and contribute directly. The Broadband Forum has membership levels for large businesses, small businesses, and individuals.
