<h2>How can I contribute?</h2>

Feedback and questions can always be given via GitHub. Due to the standards process adopted by the Broadband Forum, a contributing Broadband Forum member must adopt suggested changes and present them to the Forum as a contribution from their company. An even easier way is to <a href="https://www.broadband-forum.org/about-the-broadband-forum/membership/becoming-a-bbf-member">become a member</a> and contribute directly. The Broadband Forum has membership levels for large businesses, small businesses, and individuals.
