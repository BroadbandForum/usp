# What is USP?

The **User Services Platform** is a standardized protocol for managing, monitoring, upgrading, and controlling connected devices. USP allows service providers, consumer electronics manufacturers, and end users to:

* Perform **lifecycle management** of consumer connected devices
* Enable **IoT and consumer electronics upgradability** for critical security patches
* **Bootstrap and configure** newly installed or purchased devices and virtual services
* Let customer support **monitor and troubleshoot** connected devices, services, and home network links
* Easily map the home network to **control service quality and monitor threats**
* Securely **control IoT, smart home, and smart networking functions** locally or from the Cloud
* **Enable multi-tenant** (i.e., multi-stakeholder) management and control

USP represents the natural evolution of the Broadband Forum's [CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP)](http://www.broadband-forum.org/cwmp), commonly known as TR-069. It uses an expanded version of the Device:2 Data Model to represent device operations (firmware upgrades, reboots, etc.), network interfaces, and service functions (IoT functions, VoIP, etc.).

## Project resources

* The [specification](https://usp.technology/specification/) directory contains the full text of the current version of the protocol, and the Protocol Buffers schema for the syntax of USP messages. Use this section when developing your USP compliant implementation.
* Visit https://usp-data-models.broadband-forum.org/ for more information about the Device:2 data model (also known as "TR-181i2 - Device:2 Data Model for TR-069 devices and USP Agents") specific to USP. The raw XML files used in development can be found in this directory as well as the HTML report generated by the BBF provided tools (https://github.com/BroadbandForum/cwmp-xml-tools). Use these to find the objects required for a USP implementation, and when developing the objects, interfaces, services, etc. that you want to manage and control with USP.
* Visit https://usp-compliance.broadband-forum.org/ for a list of the test cases executed to validate USP Agent implementations and seek certification.
