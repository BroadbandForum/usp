  ## What is USP?

  The **User Services Platform** is a standardized **protocol for managing,
  monitoring, upgrading, and controlling connected devices**. USP allows
  service providers, consumer electronics manufacturers, and end users to:

  * Create interoperable and vendor-independent **managed Wi-Fi systems**.
  * Perform **lifecycle management** of consumer connected devices and
    containerized microservices.
  * Support **independent applications** for application-enabled services
    gateways.
  * Enable **IoT and consumer electronics upgradability** for critical
    security patches.
  * Develop applications that gather the telemetry necessary to **mass data
    processing, AI, and machine learning**.
  * **Bootstrap and configure** newly installed or purchased devices and
    applications.
  * Let customer support **monitor and troubleshoot** connected devices,
    services, and home network links.
  * Easily map the home network to **control service quality and monitor
    threats**.
  * Securely **control IoT, smart home, and smart networking functions**
    locally or from the Cloud.
  * **Enable multi-tenant** (i.e., multi-stakeholder) management and control.

  USP represents the natural evolution of the Broadband Forum's [CPE WAN
  Management Protocol (CWMP)](http://www.broadband-forum.org/cwmp), commonly
  known as TR-069. It uses an expanded version of the Device:2 Data Model to
  represent device operations (firmware upgrades, reboots, etc.), network
  interfaces, and service functions (IoT functions, VoIP, etc.).

          Release contains specification for the User Services Platform 1.2

              it will ignore ValueChange subscriptions on a given parameter
            - now provides information about whether a command is synchronous
              vs. asynchronous
            - now allows requests on specific object instances and handles
              divergent data models
          * Defines discovery mechanisms for Endpoints connected to STOMP and
            MQTT brokers
