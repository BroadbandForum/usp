# TR-369: The User Services Platform

*A standardized protocol to manage, monitor, update, and control
connected devices, IoT endpoints, user services and home networks*

See <https://usp.technology> for the current USP specification.

## What is USP?

The **User Services Platform** is a standardized **protocol for managing,
monitoring, upgrading, and controlling connected devices**. USP allows
service providers, consumer electronics manufacturers, and end users to:

* Create interoperable and vendor-independent **managed Wi-Fi systems**.
* Perform **lifecycle management** of consumer connected devices and
  containerized microservices.
* Support **independent applications** for application-enabled services
  gateways.
* Enable **IoT and consumer electronics upgradability** for critical
  security patches.
* Develop applications that gather the telemetry necessary to **mass data
  processing, AI, and machine learning**.
* **Bootstrap and configure** newly installed or purchased devices and
  applications.
* Let customer support **monitor and troubleshoot** connected devices,
  services, and home network links.
* Easily map the home network to **control service quality and monitor
  threats**.
* Securely **control IoT, smart home, and smart networking functions**
  locally or from the Cloud.
* **Enable multi-tenant** (i.e., multi-stakeholder) management and control.

USP represents the natural evolution of the Broadband Forum's [CPE WAN
Management Protocol (CWMP)](http://www.broadband-forum.org/cwmp), commonly
known as TR-069. It uses an expanded version of the Device:2 Data Model to
represent device operations (firmware upgrades, reboots, etc.), network
interfaces, and service functions (IoT functions, VoIP, etc.).
