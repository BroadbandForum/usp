  ## What is USP?

  The **User Services Platform** is a standardized **protocol for managing,
  monitoring, upgrading, and controlling connected devices**. USP allows
  service providers, consumer electronics manufacturers, and end users to:

  * Create interoperable and vendor-independent **managed Wi-Fi systems**.
  * Perform **lifecycle management** of consumer connected devices and
    containerized microservices.
  * Support **independent applications** for application-enabled services
    gateways.
  * Enable **IoT and consumer electronics upgradability** for critical
    security patches.
  * Develop applications that gather the telemetry necessary to **mass data
    processing, AI, and machine learning**.
  * **Bootstrap and configure** newly installed or purchased devices and
    applications.
  * Let customer support **monitor and troubleshoot** connected devices,
    services, and home network links.
  * Easily map the home network to **control service quality and monitor
    threats**.
  * Securely **control IoT, smart home, and smart networking functions**
    locally or from the Cloud.
  * **Enable multi-tenant** (i.e., multi-stakeholder) management and control.

  USP represents the natural evolution of the Broadband Forum's [CPE WAN
  Management Protocol (CWMP)](http://www.broadband-forum.org/cwmp), commonly
  known as TR-069. It uses an expanded version of the Device:2 Data Model to
  represent device operations (firmware upgrades, reboots, etc.), network
  interfaces, and service functions (IoT functions, VoIP, etc.).
