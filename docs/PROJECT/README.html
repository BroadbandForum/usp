<h1 id="tr-369-the-user-services-platform">TR-369: The User Services
Platform</h1>
<p><em>A standardized protocol to manage, monitor, update, and control
connected devices, IoT endpoints, user services and home
networks</em></p>
<p>See <a href="https://usp.technology"
class="uri">https://usp.technology</a> for the current USP
specification.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-usp">What is USP?</h2>
<p>The <strong>User Services Platform</strong> is a standardized
<strong>protocol for managing, monitoring, upgrading, and controlling
connected devices</strong>. USP allows service providers, consumer
electronics manufacturers, and end users to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create interoperable and vendor-independent <strong>managed Wi-Fi
systems</strong>.</li>
<li>Perform <strong>lifecycle management</strong> of consumer connected
devices and containerized microservices.</li>
<li>Support <strong>independent applications</strong> for
application-enabled services gateways.</li>
<li>Enable <strong>IoT and consumer electronics upgradability</strong>
for critical security patches.</li>
<li>Develop applications that gather the telemetry necessary to
<strong>mass data processing, AI, and machine learning</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Bootstrap and configure</strong> newly installed or
purchased devices and applications.</li>
<li>Let customer support <strong>monitor and troubleshoot</strong>
connected devices, services, and home network links.</li>
<li>Easily map the home network to <strong>control service quality and
monitor threats</strong>.</li>
<li>Securely <strong>control IoT, smart home, and smart networking
functions</strong> locally or from the Cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Enable multi-tenant</strong> (i.e., multi-stakeholder)
management and control.</li>
</ul>
<p>USP represents the natural evolution of the Broadband Forumâ€™s <a
href="http://www.broadband-forum.org/cwmp">CPE WAN Management Protocol
(CWMP)</a>, commonly known as TR-069. It uses an expanded version of the
Device:2 Data Model to represent device operations (firmware upgrades,
reboots, etc.), network interfaces, and service functions (IoT
functions, VoIP, etc.).</p>
