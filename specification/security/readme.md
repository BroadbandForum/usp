# Security

USP provides an end-to-end security mechanism in addition to any security provided by the Message Transfer Protocol.

**R-SEC.0** – All USP endpoints MUST implement the USP end-to-end security mechanism.

**R-SEC.1** – All USP messages MUST be secured by the USP end-to-end security mechanism.

The current discussion on the structure and requirements for the USP end-to-end security mechanism is available for Broadband Forum members to view on the BBF wiki at:
