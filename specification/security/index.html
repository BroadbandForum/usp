<h1 id="security">Security</h1>
<p>USP provides an end-to-end security mechanism in addition to any security provided by the Message Transfer Protocol.</p>
<p><strong>R-SEC.0</strong> – All USP endpoints MUST implement the USP end-to-end security mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>R-SEC.1</strong> – All USP messages MUST be secured by the USP end-to-end security mechanism.</p>
<p>The current discussion on the structure and requirements for the USP end-to-end security mechanism is available for Broadband Forum members to view on the BBF wiki at:</p>

<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
<p>Authentication of USP Endpoints to establish trust with each other <em>at the USP layer</em> is handled via the information and requirements in the <code>.ControllerTrust.</code> object of the data model.</p>
<p><strong>R.SEC.2</strong> - USP Agents and Controllers MUST adhere to the Authentication requirements defined for the <code>.ControllerTrust.</code> object defined in the <a href="https://www.broadband-forum.org/technical/download/TR-181_Issue-2_Amendment-12.pdf" title="TR-181 Issue 2 Device Data Model for TR-069">Device:2 Data Model for TR-069 Devices and USP Agents</a>.</p>
<h2 id="access-control">Access Control</h2>
<p>Access Control covers the permission scheme that Controllers and Agents apply to each other. Access Control can be applied to single objects or parameters, or a set of object parameters, based on these schemes. The mechanism for adding, removing, and modifying schemes is defined in the USP data model.</p>
<p><strong>R.SEC.3</strong> - USP Agents and Controllers MUST adhere to the Access Control requirements defined for the <code>.ControllerTrust.</code> object defined in the <a href="https://www.broadband-forum.org/technical/download/TR-181_Issue-2_Amendment-12.pdf" title="TR-181 Issue 2 Device Data Model for TR-069">Device:2 Data Model for TR-069 Devices and USP Agents</a>.</p>
