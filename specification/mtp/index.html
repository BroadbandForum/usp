<h1 id="message-transfer-protocols">Message Transfer Protocols</h1>
<p>USP messages are sent between Endpoints over one or more Message Transfer Protocols.</p>
<p>Note: Message Transfer Protocol was a term adopted to avoid confusion with the term “Transport”, which is often overloaded to include both application layer (i.e. HTTP) and the actual OSI Transport layer (i.e. TCP). Throughout this document, Message Transfer Protocol (MTP) refers to application layer transport.</p>
<p>The requirements for each individual Message Transfer Protocol is covered in an Annex of this document. This version of the specification includes definitions for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="./coap/">Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>USP contains its own <a href="/security/">application layer security mechanism</a>. While use of this security is necessary, it may not always be sufficient for certain deployment scenarios. USP recommends the following requirement on use of MTP security:</p>
<p><strong>R-MTP.0</strong> – The Message Transfer Protocol MUST use secure transport when USP messages cross inter-network boundaries.</p>
<p>For example, it may not be necessary to use MTP layer security when within an end-user’s local area network (LAN). It is necessary to secure transport to and from the Internet, however.</p>
